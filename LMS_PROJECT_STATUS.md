## Summary
- The LMS is mostly feature-complete for core flows (course, staff, assistant, auth, CRUD)
- UI and backend are modular, maintainable, and mostly clean
- Remaining work is mostly in API wiring, some UI actions, and content
- No critical blockers, but some TODOs remain for full production readiness
